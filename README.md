# StoreSenseSave

Designed & created smart warehouse model for monitoring & preventing the wastage of the grains stored in the granary/warehouse using Internet of Things. In turn maximizing profits for farmers by minimizing wasteage
Used technologies like HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, open source XAMPP server for website.
Hardware components used are Arduino, sensors (DHT11, Ultrasonic, PIR) and action devices like fan and LED strip.
The data collected from sensors is relayed to the website to display with a delay.
The action of DHT11 sensor (high temperature/humidity) switches on fan to cool down temperature.
The action of PIR sensor (presence of human) switches on LED strip implemented in the model (can be scaled) to prevent theft.
Text to speech is also implemented for the ease of use of a farmer which speaks out the condition in Hindi.
